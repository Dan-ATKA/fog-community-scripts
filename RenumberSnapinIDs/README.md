### Renumber Snapin IDs. Author: Wayne Workman & Tom Elliott
---


As you use your FOG Server over time creating and deleting snapins, your snapin IDs will continue to climb higher. This utility will re-number all of your snapin ID numbers as well as re-set the auto-increment number. This utility will preserve all current snapin assignments to hosts, and will also give you a write-out of what was changed to what. Your new snapin IDs will begin with 1.
