### Renumber Image IDs. Author: Wayne Workman.
---


As you use your FOG Server over time creating and deleting images, your image IDs will continue to climb higher. 
For me, they have gotten nearly to 200 before. This utility will re-number all of your image ID numbers as
well as re-set the auto-increment number. This utility will preserve all current image assignments to hosts,
and will also give you a write-out of what was changed to what. Your new image IDs will begin with 1.

This utility is subject to the fog-community-scripts license.
