* All this does is take my files as I have edited them and copies them to my trunk directory for subversion/svn.
* The extra “trunk2” stuff you see is for btsync when that was running.
* If I call it as copytosvn git it will do the same as for trunk, but to only the git. This was added due to sourceforge being down last year.
